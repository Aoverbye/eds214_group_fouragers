# Fouraging through this analytical workflow

The purpose of this data project is to practice creating and following an analytical workflow and collaborating using GitHub.  

## Description

The first part aims to recreate a plot of stream chemistry variables using data from the Luquillo LTER. In the second part, we created our own research question to explore if sodium concentrations differed across the four sample sites and their respective altitudes. Additionally, we wanted to see if this concentration was at all impacted by Hurricane Hugo. 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies
